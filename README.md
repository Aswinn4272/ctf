# CTF

Hi! If you manage to get congrats, you are soo close!
Note that you don't need modify master (and it's not allowed you will get disqualified...), so any change you do, do it in a branch.

Whenever you finish your job, clean the repo removing the branch you created (and any other log that you might have created):

To remove a branch:
```bash
git push origin -d <branch-name> #remove remote branch
git branch -D <branch-name> #remove local branch
```
