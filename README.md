# CTF

If you are going to modify this repo you can do it in your own branch and you don't need to merge it to master!

Whenever you finish your job, clean the repo removing the branch you created (and ay other log that you might have created):

```bash
git push origin -d <branch-name> #remove remote branch
git branch -D <branch-name> #remove local branch
```
